Therefore, it is a function with a variable number of parameters.  Depending on the type of layer desired, there are different functions to create each one of them. A couple of examples are the functions `Conv`, which allows for the creation of convolutional layers, or `MaxPool`, which allows for the creation of MaxPooling layers. These layers are used in more advanced models that will be seen in other subjects of the programme and that are beyond the syllabus of this subject.  In this subject, as only multilayer perceptrons will be covered, the layers will always be created fully connected with the function `Dense`. This function accepts as parameters the number of inputs, outputs, and the transfer function of the neurons in the layer. In this sense, two different cases can be distinguished when creating ANNs, depending on the problem to be solved: \n",

The demonstration is the following one: if a neuron models a function similar to $ f_1(x) = m_1 x + b_1 $, and similarly for a neuron from the second layer $ f_2(x) = m_2 x + b_2 $, then if the result from the first neuron is transfered to the second one without a non-lineal conversion:\n",

In this way, the output of a neuron for a pattern can be interpreted as the degree of certainty that the pattern belongs to the class corresponding to that neuron.  Unlike the previous case, a sigmoidal transfer function is not applied to the outputs of each neuron in the output layer to bound the output between 0 and 1, but no function (identity function) is applied.  Instead, a `softmax` function is applied to the outputs of all the neurons, which takes unbounded numeric values and returns numeric values between 0 and 1 such that the sum of all values is 1.  Even though this function does not constitute a layer of neurons, sometimes this last `softmax` function is considered as an additional layer, and in fact, from the point of view of programming with the `Flux` library, it is effectively performed as if it were a last layer, as can be seen in this example:"

This way of passing the patterns, which may seem cumbersome, has its motivation, since when the set of patterns is very large, calculating the modifications to the weights with all the patterns can be very costly.  For this reason, the patterns are usually divided into batches so that each update is done with only one of these batches. If this were done, the array passed as a parameter, instead of having one tuple, would have several, one per batch.  However, in the exercises to be carried out in this subject, this will not be done, and all the patterns will be passed together. \n",

    "# Julia Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "As any other language, Julia allows the creation of functions. There are several ways to create functions, the most common are these two:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When the operation to be performed is simple, the function can be declared on one line without the need for the reserved word function.  This is the case for operations that can be performed in one or a few lines of code.  In the latter case, parentheses can be used to enclose the actions to be performed, and `;` to separate them.  The value to be returned by the function will be the last thing to be evaluated, although the reserved word `return` can also be used.  Here are a couple of examples of this way of declaring functions:\n",
    "    ```julia\n",
    "         add(x::Float32, y::Float32) = x+x; \n",
    "         mse(outputs::Array{Float32,1}, targets:: Array{Float32,1}) = mean((targets.-outputs).^2);\n",
    "         avgGreaterThan0(valores::Array{Float32,1}) = mean(values[values.>0]); \n",
    "         avgGreaterThan0(valores::Array{Float32,1}) = ( positives=values.>0; mean(values[positives]); )   \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. In many other cases, a function may perform many complex operations that are impractical to write on a single line.  In this case, you can declare the function with the reserved word `function`, and return the result with the reserved word `return`.  As is common in programming languages, evaluating `return` immediately exits the function.  If `return` is not used, the result returned by function will be the last one evaluated.  The example above is shown below: \n",
    "   ```julia\n",
    "         function avgGreaterThan0(Values::Array{Float32,1})    \n",
    "            positives=values.>0;    \n",
    "            return mean(Values[positives]); \n",
    "         end;  \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  When passing parameters, it is not mandatory, but recommended, to indicate the type of the parameters.  If this is not done, they are assumed to be of type `Any`.  However, a common practice in Julia is to overload functions, i.e. to define functions with the same name but different parameters or of different types.  When calling a function, the correct function will be executed, if any of the ones defined match the parameters passed. This allows different behaviours to be defined. When a function call is made, Julia checks that there exists in memory a definition with that name in which the types of the passed arguments match the defined ones and, if it exists, it will execute it with those parameters.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In the examples above, the parameters have been defined as `Float32` or `Array{Float32,2}`, which means that the functions are defined for those specific types, and therefore, if calls are made with parameters of type `Float64` or `Array{Float64,2}`, a suitable function definition will not be found, and an error will be raised.  To solve this, it is worthy to apply the subtyping properties as seen in the previous tutorial to define the most generic types that the function can work with. For example, instead of using `Float32`, you can use `AbstractFloat`, `Real` or `Number` types (be aware that the latter type includes complex numbers). Instead of using `Array{Float32,2}`, you could use `Array{<:AbstractFloat}`, `Array{<:Real}` or `Array{<:Number}`. Additionaly, it is needed to take into remember that there are other types that behave like arrays but are not arrays. An important example that will be used in this subject is when transposing arrays, which creates an object that is not of type `Array`, but of type `LinearAlgebra.Adjoint`, but that can be used as if it were an array because its operations are defined as such.  Both `Array` and `LinearAlgebra.Adjoint` are subtypes of `AbstractArray`, as can be seen in the following example: "
